# Open Raman

The History:

I started this project for fun. I'm a science lover, especially involving physics and chemistry.

I have a lot of experience designing 3D printer parts for the industry, so i decided apply this knowledge to design an easy to build Professional Raman Spectrometer, using FDM and SLS 3D printer technology.

The goal of the project is, have in the end of the project, a reliable spectrometer costing less than 1K euros, for research purposes and everything that you consider fun to use a high end spectrophotometer.

The 4 pillars of the project:


 - All the custom made parts of the equipment designed to be printed in FDM and SLS 3D printers (for very accurate parts), SLS is expensive but it make our lifes easier to align the optics.

 - The spectometer unit will be constructed in a module form factor, that can be used as a general purpose spectometer.

- The electronics will use cheap devlopment boards (RaspberryPi) with simpler as possible shield to provide the interface for all the hardware.

- The design will focus on use of less as possible expensive optics but without loose quality of amostration.


Another details of the project will be supplied in Project Documentation Folder.
